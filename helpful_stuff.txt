------ UI handling, loadning, adding to scene tree ------

add ui Control nodes to UiFunc.player_ui    This will 'glue' it to a canvas item so it doesnt move with player if camera doesnt move



------ Adding resources, actors, npcs, monsters  ------

Monsters:


NPCS:
    Make a talk tree json file in resources/actors/npcs/talk_trees
    IMPORTANT: figure out how to store shop keeper and quest components, now shopkeeper and quest giver components are given in NpcDefinitions and their talk_tree.json files

TALK stuff:
    talk tree json setup:
        - 3 main elements: (1) base_talk  (2) dynamic_components  (3) additional_dialoges

Dialoge tree element setup:
    {
        "name/uid of the dialoge element": {
            "lines": [array of strings, the lines]
            "options" [ array of options the player can say
                has to have "label"
                can have "leads_to"
                can have "action"
            ]
        }
    }


Components:
    add id an name to GameData.ComponentKeys and GameData.COMPONENTS
    add script path to DirectoryPaths.component_paths
